  "description": "You spawn in the heart of a vast warm ocean basin, surrounded by towering badlands mesas and scattered desert patches. The central ocean is rich with coral and tropical fish, while the badlands cliffs form a natural amphitheater. To the northeast, badlands and desert give way to plains and savannas, offering potential villages. Southwest lies a frozen ocean and snowy tundra with drifting icebergs and polar bears. Northwest features dense dark forests and woodlands, while the southeast blends swamps with warm coastal waters. The badlands hide abandoned mineshafts rich in gold, and the coasts host ruined portals and ocean monuments. This seed offers a unique enclosed ocean hub with multiple climate zones and abundant resources for building, survival, or exploration."
